# Day 6

This program interprets a corrupted "repetition code" and tries to recover the
original message. It accepts a list of strings as input, determines the most
frequently used letter in each position and prints the answer.

For example:

```
eedadn
drvtee
eandsr
raavrd
atevrs
tsrnev
sdttsa
rasrtv
nssdts
ntnada
svetve
tesnvt
vntsnd
vrdear
dvrsen
enarar
```

The most common character in the first column is `e`, in the second `a`, in
the third `s`, and so on. The message from this example is `easter`.
